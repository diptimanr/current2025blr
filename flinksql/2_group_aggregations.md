### Aggregations
Compute a single result from multiple input rows in a table.

Like most data systems, Apache FlinkÂ® supports aggregate functions. 
An aggregate function computes a single result from multiple input rows. 
For example, there are aggregates to compute the COUNT, SUM, AVG (average), MAX (maximum) and MIN (minimum) values over a set of rows.
